As data becomes ever richer, and as our analytic techniques grow in complexity, there is a growing need for visualization that can communicate data insights to people. It is often the case that simple data visualizations are the most effective at communicating information. But even with these simple data visualizations, there is a complex ecosystem of software and services, data providers and hardware form factors, competing user demands for simplicity and high-interactivity, the need to use these visualizations in a standalone context and in a visual analytics suite - and satisfying all of these competing demands requires multiple implementations of the same visualizations.</p>\n<!--docs enable simple-->\n<p><img src=\"/images/datavis-concerns.jpg\" alt=\"The concerns of data visualization\"></p>\n<p>Our team develops data visualizations and visual analytic applications that are designed to improve the workflow of data scientists we work with, and to give their techniques and insights to broader audiences at Microsoft and the open-source community as a whole.
