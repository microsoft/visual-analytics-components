## About Microsoft Visual Analytics Components

The _Microsoft Visual Analytics Components_ project is a research system exploring the concept of **disaggregated visualization**, which is a concept that envisions a rich ecosystem of context-free data visualizations that can be independently composed and configured into visual analytic applications, consumed for presentations and dashboards, and are responsive to different screen sizes and interactivity available. This is a very broad goal, and because of the huge scope of that idea, this project attempts to explore a subset of these ideas. We consider this library to be a sandbox for experimenting with the ideas of component-based visual analytics applications.

**Visual analytics** applications are complex systems with pre-designed behavior and features. These features are designed to support specific analytic tasks and workflows. A central idea of Disaggregated Visualization is to invert this paradigm: what if the visualizations drove the available interactions? What if, instead of behavior being designed into a system, it emerged from interaction between visualizations?
